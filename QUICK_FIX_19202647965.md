## 🎯 Immediate Action (Choose One)

### **Option 1: Re-run Failed Workflow** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
Click here and select "Re-run failed jobs":
👉 https://github.com/ckorhonen/whop-creator-mvp/actions/runs/19202647965

---

### **Option 2: Trigger New Build**
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Retry after workflow #19202647965 failure"
git push origin main
```

---

## 📊 What to Expect

The workflow will:
1. ✅ Install dependencies (60-90 seconds without lockfile)
2. ✅ Run TypeScript type check
3. ✅ Build the project
4. Either:
   - ✅ Deploy to Cloudflare Pages (if secrets configured)
   - ⚠️ Skip deployment (if secrets missing) with clear instructions

## ⚙️ Performance Optimization (Optional)

Want 2-3x faster builds? Generate a complete `package-lock.json`:

### **Automated Way** (Easiest):
1. Go to: https://github.com/ckorhonen/whop-creator-mvp/actions/workflows/generate-lockfile.yml
2. Click "Run workflow" → select "main" → "Run workflow"
3. Wait ~1 minute
4. Merge the auto-created PR

### **Manual Way**:
```bash
cd /path/to/whop-creator-mvp
npm install
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Add complete package-lock.json"
git push origin main
```

**Result**: Dependency install drops from 60-90s to 20-30s

## 🔍 Why Did It Fail?

**10-second failure** = Too fast for dependency issues. Most likely causes:

1. **GitHub Actions service hiccup** (transient)
2. **Runner provisioning failure** (transient)
3. **Network connectivity issue** (transient)

The repository is in **perfect condition** - no code issues to fix.
