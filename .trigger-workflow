Generated at: 2025-11-09T04:46:35Z

The workflow will:
1. Clean npm cache and remove incomplete lockfile
2. Generate complete package-lock.json with npm install --package-lock-only
3. Verify the lockfile has all packages and integrity hashes
4. Test installation with npm ci
5. Commit the updated lockfile back to this branch

Expected result: Complete package-lock.json with hundreds of packages and integrity hashes.
