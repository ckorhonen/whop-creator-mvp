# Lockfile Integrity Fix Summary

## Problem Detected
- ❌ Package-lock.json was incomplete or had integrity issues
- ❌ This prevents proper dependency verification
- ❌ Causes security and reproducibility issues

## Changes Made
- ✅ Regenerated complete package-lock.json with valid integrity hashes
- 📦 Fixed integrity for all packages in the dependency tree
- 🔒 Enabled proper dependency verification

## What This Fixes
- ✅ Ensures packages are verified against their checksums
- ✅ Prevents tampered or corrupted packages
- ✅ Enables security scanning and audit tools
- ✅ Ensures reproducible builds
- ✅ Complies with npm security best practices

## Statistics
- Total packages: $PACKAGE_COUNT
- Packages with integrity hashes: $INTEGRITY_COUNT

## Next Steps
1. Review the integrity hash changes
2. Merge to enable proper dependency verification
3. All future installs will verify package integrity
